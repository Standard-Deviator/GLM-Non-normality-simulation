# GLM-Non-normality-simulation
Monte Carlo simulation assessing the impact which varying approaches for dealing with non-normal model residuals has on confidence interval properties

The simulation itself is contained within "main_sim.R". It relys upon a few packages. The most important package is SimDesign, and it requires three specific functions: Generate, Analyse, Summarise functions. Each of these functions are defined within "funtions_v5.R". The population matrices required for the Generate function are defined within "Pop_Matrices_Adkins.R".

Running the code within "main_sim.R" will automatically call the other two supporting R-scripts.

Feel free to email me any questions you have regarding the simulation itself or the code.
